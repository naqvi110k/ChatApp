# ChatApp
ChatApp is a modern, real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the server. This project is designed to provide a seamless and efficient chat experience.
